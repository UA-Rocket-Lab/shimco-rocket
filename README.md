# SHIMCO Project Repository

Welcome to the SHIMCO (Spatial Heterodyne Interferometric Molecular Cloud Observer) project repository. This repository contains resources, data, and scripts designed to support the development, analysis, and visualization of data related to SHIMCO's mission: observing molecular hydrogen (H2) emission from molecular clouds to understand star formation processes and cloud evolution.

## Directory Contents

### **Data Files**
1. **`ob_catalogue.csv`**
   - Contains cataloged data of OB stars retrieved from SiMBAD, to be used for SHIMCO target selection. Includes: star names (using Gaia DR3 standard), spectral types (all O- and B-type), apparent magnitudes in V-band (most readily available of the bands), galactic latitudes and longitudes, and radial velocities.

2. **`extra_stars.csv`**
   - Contains names of stars from catalogue assembled by Jo. Used to supplement catalogue retrieved from SiMBAD.

3. **ob_catalogue_spectra**
   - Contains retrieved IUE spectra for as many OB stars from ob_catalogue as are available.

4. **`uncor_100K.peaks`, `uncor_500K.peaks`, `uncor_1000K.peaks`, `uncor_2000K.peaks`, `uncor_3000K.peaks`**
   - Fitted spectral features from theoretical spectra corresponding to molecular hydrogen fluorescence emission at various temperatures. Can be used to generate synthetic spectra and compare them to observations. Obtained from Dr. Erika Hamden.

### **Scripts**
1. **`extract_OB_catalogue.py`**
   - This script queries the SIMBAD astronomical database for O-type and B-type stars. It processes the retrieved data to include key stellar parameters such as coordinates, spectral type, and radial velocity, and saves the results to a CSV file.

2. **`extract_IUE_spectra.py`**
   - This script queries the MAST archive for archival IUE spectra of OB stars using SiMBAD. It retrieves and processes SWP observations, extracts wavelength and flux data, and saves the spectra to CSV files.

3. **`plot_OB_catalogue.py`**
   - This script plots OB stars from catalogue generated by extract_OB_catalogue.py alongside IUE spectra generated by extract_IUE_spectra.
   - Source code for Render web service which displays GUI on ua-rocket-lab.github.io website.

### **Project Goals**
1. **Scientific Objectives**:
   - Examine molecular hydrogen transitions to explore the HI/H2 boundary layers in the molecular clouds.
   - Investigate star formation efficiency and molecular cloud dispersal mechanisms.

2. **Technology Development**:
   - Demonstrate the capabilities of SHIMCO's Spatial Heterodyne Spectroscopy system for future space-based missions.

3. **Educational Outcomes**:
   - Train graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in advanced UV spectroscopy techniques and sounding rocket operations.
